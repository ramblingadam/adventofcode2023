// you walk, the Elf shows you a small bag and some cubes which are either red, green, or blue. Each time you play this game, he will hide a secret number of cubes of each color in the bag, and your goal is to figure out information about the number of cubes.

// To get information, once a bag has been loaded with cubes, the Elf will reach into the bag, grab a handful of random cubes, show them to you, and then put them back in the bag. He'll do this a few times per game.

// You play several games and record the information from each game (your puzzle input). Each game is listed with its ID number (like the 11 in Game 11: ...) followed by a semicolon-separated list of subsets of cubes that were revealed from the bag (like 3 red, 5 green, 4 blue).

// For example, the record of a few games might look like this:

// Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
// Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
// Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
// Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
// Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green

// In game 1, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag (and then put back again). The first set is 3 blue cubes and 4 red cubes; the second set is 1 red cube, 2 green cubes, and 6 blue cubes; the third set is only 2 green cubes.

// The Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if the bag contained only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes?

// In the example above, games 1, 2, and 5 would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with that configuration. However, game 3 would have been impossible because at one point the Elf showed you 20 red cubes at once; similarly, game 4 would also have been impossible because the Elf showed you 15 blue cubes at once. If you add up the IDs of the games that would have been possible, you get 8.

// Determine which games would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes. What is the sum of the IDs of those games?

/*
take in two params:
1st param: a string of games, each game separated by a newline. each game has an ID - game 1's id is 1, etc
each game is a series of cubes drawn in the format:
 numberOfCube1 colorOfCube1, numOfCube2 colorOfCube2, etc. - each draw separated by semicolons

2nd param: a collection of numbers and colors representing the total amount of cubes in the bag. (puzzle leaves it open, let's use an object for this param)
for example: {red: 12, green: 13, blue: 14}.

return the SUM of all game IDs where the second param is a possible total number of cubes in the bag.

split all games by newline
reduce: acc starts at 0, curr is a game
  split the current game by semicolon to get the draws
  reduce each draw into a boolean: true if possible given param 2, false if not
    to confirm if a given draw is possible:
    make an object to store colors and numbers
    split the draw into colors on ', '
      split those colors into numbers and colors on ' '
      add colors and nums to the object
    loop through our new object:
      compare to param 2:
        if a color is NOT in param 2, fail it
        is the value for a color is greater than the value for that same color in param2, fail it
        if we reach the end of the loop with no fails, pass it! move on to next draw
    if all draws for a game pass, then add the id of that game to the accumulator()

PART 2:
in each game, what is the FEWEST number of cubes of each color to make each game possible?
the result should be given as the POWER: which is the number of red, green, and blue cubes multiplied together.
the final result, we want the SUM of all POWERS across all games.

find the largest number of cubes of each color among the draws in a game.
as we look at each game, init an object smallest = {red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0}
after we've mapped out each draw, compare the values to our smallest. If the value for any color is larger than the current smallest value, overwrite that smallest value.
after going through all draws, multiply all smallest values together, and add to an accumulator
